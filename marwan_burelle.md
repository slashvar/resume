Current Position
----------------
Since 2006

- **Team Leader** at EPITA's System Laboratory (LSE)

### Current Projects

- **Automatic Malware classification:** using deep learning for clustering large
  set of malware by famillies. Part of ViralStudio (funded project on malware
  classification.)
- **Geometric Spanner and Clustering:** exploiting construction of sparse graph
  known as geometric spanner for clustering large set of data in higher
  dimensions euclidean space.
- **Concurrent Data Structures in Kernel Space:** implementations of lock-free
  data structures for an experimental kernel. Implementation in C based on
  intrusive lists approach with *hazard-pointers* and *RCU* semi-automatic memory
  management. This work also include study of integrating efficient concurrent
  data structures in userland for modern C++.
- **Diameter Computing for Very Large Graph:** finding strategies to
  efficiently compute diameter of huge graphs. Experimental new algorithms
  written in C, C++ and Go.

### Older Project

- **C!:** a compiler-to-compiler based language designed for kernel programming
  with object oriented features and lower-level programming oriented syntactic
  sugar.

Education
---------

- **DEA I³** (2002) Université Paris SUD Orsay - Master in Computer Science
  **Master Thesis:** Dynamic Security Analysis for XML Documents Transformation

### Ph.D
- **Security Analysis for XML Transformation**
- **Subject:** XML documents can serve as storage for semi-structured data and
  transformation languages can act as query mechanism. Traditional access
  control mechanisms are hard to map on tree based data structures such like
  XML, so we decided to investigate information flow analysis in a
  transformation language (CDuce.) Our analysis is based on a modified version
  of the *non-interference* property more suited for fined analysis of a
  language with type case and semantic-subtyping.
- **Doctoral - All But Dissertation.**

### Skills
- **Programming:** More than 15 years of programming experience, in C, C++
  and OCaml, but also Go, Python, Java, SQL, Prolog … I have also developed some
  skills in **parallel programming** using C++11, go, POSIX-threads or Intel's
  TBB.
- **Computer Science:** Huge graph exploration, deep learning (applied binary
  files classification) using modern framework like Keras, Theano or Tensor flow, typing
  and type inference …
- **Teaching:** 10 years of teaching in Computer Science field: programming,
  algorithms, graph theory, parallel programming …
- French (native language)
- English (fluent, spoken and written)
