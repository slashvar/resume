Current Position
----------------
Since 2018

- **C++ Senior Software Engineer** at Algolia

### Current Projects

- **Algolia Search Engine:** full feature textual search engine in C++
    - Search and indexing services deployed on more than 2000 servers
    - **Code maintainance:** refactoring and evolution of a large C++ code base
    - **On call:** incident response for the search service (99.999% SLA)
    - **Performances:** measuring and improving preformances of the engine

Previous Positions
------------------

- **Teacher and Research Engineer** at EPITA (CS Engineering School in Paris)

    - **Automatic Malware classification:** using deep learning for clustering large
      set of malware by famillies. Part of ViralStudio (funded project on malware
      classification.)
    - **Geometric Spanner and Clustering:** exploiting construction of sparse graph
      known as geometric spanner for clustering large set of data in higher
      dimensions euclidean space.
    - **Concurrent Data Structures in Kernel Space:** implementations of lock-free
      data structures for an experimental kernel.
    - **Diameter Computing for Very Large Graph:** finding strategies to
      efficiently compute diameter of huge graphs. Experimental new algorithms
      written in C, C++ and Go.
    - **C!:** a compiler-to-compiler based language designed for kernel programming
      with object oriented features and lower-level programming oriented syntactic
      sugar.

Education
---------

- **DEA I³** (2002) Université Paris SUD Orsay - Master in Computer Science
  - **Master Thesis:** Dynamic Security Analysis for XML Documents Transformation

### Ph.D
- **Security Analysis for XML Transformation**
- **Subject:** XML documents can serve as storage for semi-structured data and
  transformation languages can act as query mechanism. Traditional access
  control mechanisms are hard to map on tree based data structures such like
  XML, so we decided to investigate information flow analysis in a
  transformation language (CDuce.) Our analysis is based on a modified version
  of the *non-interference* property more suited for fined analysis of a
  language with type case and semantic-subtyping.
- **Doctoral - All But Dissertation.**

### Skills
- **Programming:** 20 years of programming experience, in C, C++
  and OCaml, but also Go, Python, Java, SQL …
- **Teaching:** 15 years of teaching Computer Science
- French (native language)
- English (fluent, spoken and written)
